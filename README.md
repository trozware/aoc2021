# Advent of Code 2021


This is using Swift, so comes as an Xcode project, using the macOS Command Line Tool template.

If you only want to see the code for each day, open the **AoC2021** folder and read the relevant **DayXX.swift** file.

In the Xcode project:

- **main.swift** - sets the current day number and runs the code for that day.

- **DayXX.swift** - contains the code for each day.

- **Template.swift** - blank version of DayXX.swift

- **Utils.swift** - parsing and timing routines.

- **Data folder** - text files to contain the puzzle data for each day.

- **Test folder** - text files to contain the test data for each day.

**Create files.py** was used to make all these blank data files, after I made their folders manually.
